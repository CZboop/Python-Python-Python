# Postfix Calculator

<!-- TODO: background on what this is -->

1. Create a calculator that takes a string calculation using standard infix notation and gives the calculation result as output (e.g. the operators are between the numbers they should calculate on so 2 + 2 input and output of 4)
2. Create another calculator that takes a string calculation using the rarer postfix notation and gives the calculation result as output (e.g. the operators are after the numbers they should calculate on so 2 2 + input and output of 4)
Hints:
- Traditionally, a stack data structure would be used. Python does not offer this as standard, but a list/array where the last item is removed first would give the same effect
